Feature: Git Flow

    One of the key features of Screwdriver is the ability to integrate directly into the developer's
    daily process - in this case, the git flow. This includes both continuous delivery
    (commit -> production) and testing proposed code changes (a.k.a. pull requests).

    Rules:
        - Users should not have to configure GitHub Hooks manually
        - Pull Request builds should use the "main" job configuration
        - Pull Request builds should have a way to identify they are in a PR build
        - GitHub statuses should only be updated for Pull Requests

    Background:
        Given an existing pipeline
        And a pipeline with all stopped builds

    Scenario: New Pull Request
        When a pull request is opened
        And it is targeting the pipeline's branch
        Then a new build from "main" should be created to test that change
        And the build should know they are in a pull request (pr no, fork, and commit)
        And the GitHub status should be updated to reflect the build's status

    Scenario: Updated Pull Request
        And an existing pull request targeting the pipeline's branch
        When new changes are pushed to that pull request
        Then any existing builds should be stopped
        Then a new build from "main" should be created to test that change

    Scenario: Closed Pull Request
        And an existing pull request targeting the pipeline's branch
        When the pull request is closed
        Then any existing builds should be stopped

    Scenario: New Commit
        When a new commit is pushed
        And it is against the pipeline's branch
        Then a new build from "main" should be created to test that change

    Scenario: New Tag
        When a tag is created
        Then a new build from "tag-triggered" should be created to test that change

    Scenario: New Annotated Tag
        When an annotated tag is created
        Then a new build from "tag-triggered" should be created to test that change

    Scenario: New Release
        When a release is created
        Then a new build from "release-triggered" should be created to test that change

    Scenario: New Release with Annotated Tag
        When a release with annotated tag is created
        Then a new build from "release-triggered" should be created to test that change
