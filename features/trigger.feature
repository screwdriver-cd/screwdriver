@trigger
Feature: Remote Trigger

    Users should be allowed to tie together workflows from different build pipelines so that they can
    express dependencies between otherwise unrelated projects.

    Eg: The following combined pipeline workflows:
        (~commit) -> (success_A) -> (success_B)

        (fail_A) -> (fail_B)

                        (parallel_B1)
        (parallel_A) ->
                        (parallel_B2)



        Assume Pipeline B generally depends on Pipeline A. A user should be able to build Pipeline B
        when Pipeline A has been built. A user can also make it specific to a job so that
        Pipeline B -> (success_B) to be built when Pipeline A -> (success_A) is
        finished successfully.

    Rules:
        - Configuration for trigger must reside in Workflow/Job being triggered
        - Triggered workflow/job should start with latest commit on configured SCM branch
        - If multiple jobs in a pipeline requires the same external pipeline's Job as trigger, then
          builds for these jobs should be part of same pipeline event

    Scenario: External builds are not triggered if required build is not successful.
        Given an existing pipeline on branch "pipelineA" with job "fail_A"
        And an existing pipeline on branch "pipelineB" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires      |
            | fail_B    | ~sd@?:fail_A  |
        When the "fail_A" job on branch "pipelineA" is started
        And the "fail_A" build failed
        Then the "fail_B" job on branch "pipelineB" is not triggered

    Scenario: External build is triggered after another build is successful.
        Given an existing pipeline on branch "pipelineA" with job "success_A"
        And an existing pipeline on branch "pipelineB" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires          |
            | success_B | ~sd@?:success_A   |
        When the "success_A" job on branch "pipelineA" is started
        And the "success_A" build succeeded
        Then the "success_B" job on branch "pipelineB" is started
        And the "success_B" build's parentBuildId on branch "pipelineB" is that "success_A" build's buildId

    Scenario: Fan-out. Multiple external builds are triggered in parallel as a result of a build's success.
        Given an existing pipeline on branch "pipelineA" with job "parallel_A"
        And an existing pipeline on branch "pipelineB" with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | parallel_B1   | ~sd@?:parallel_A  |
            | parallel_B2   | ~sd@?:parallel_A  |
        When the "parallel_A" job on branch "pipelineA" is started
        And the "parallel_A" build succeeded
        Then the "parallel_B1" job on branch "pipelineB" is started
        And the "parallel_B1" build's parentBuildId on branch "pipelineB" is that "parallel_A" build's buildId
        And the "parallel_B2" job on branch "pipelineB" is started
        And the "parallel_B2" build's parentBuildId on branch "pipelineB" is that "parallel_A" build's buildId
        And builds for "parallel_B1" and "parallel_B2" jobs are part of a single event

    @beta
    Scenario: Remote Join
        Given an existing pipeline on branch "beta-remote_join1" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires                  |
            | simple    | ~commit                   |
            | parallel  | simple                    |
            | join      | parallel, sd@?:external   |
        And an existing pipeline on branch "beta-remote_join2" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires      |
            | external  | ~sd@?:simple  |
        When a new commit is pushed to "beta-remote_join1" branch with the trigger jobs
        And the "simple" job is triggered on branch "beta-remote_join1"
        And the "simple" build succeeded
        And the "parallel" job is triggered on branch "beta-remote_join1"
        And the "parallel" build succeeded
        And the "external" build's parentBuildId on branch "beta-remote_join2" is that "simple" build's buildId
        And the "external" build succeeded
        Then the "join" job is triggered from "parallel" on branch "beta-remote_join1" and "external" on branch "beta-remote_join2"
        And that "join" build uses the same SHA as the "simple" build on branch "beta-remote_join1"

    @prod
    Scenario: Remote Join
        Given an existing pipeline on branch "remote_join1" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires                  |
            | simple    | ~commit                   |
            | parallel  | simple                    |
            | join      | parallel, sd@?:external   |
        And an existing pipeline on branch "remote_join2" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires      |
            | external  | ~sd@?:simple  |
        When a new commit is pushed to "remote_join1" branch with the trigger jobs
        And the "simple" job is triggered on branch "remote_join1"
        And the "simple" build succeeded
        And the "parallel" job is triggered on branch "remote_join1"
        And the "parallel" build succeeded
        And the "external" build's parentBuildId on branch "remote_join2" is that "simple" build's buildId
        And the "external" build succeeded
        Then the "join" job is triggered from "parallel" on branch "remote_join1" and "external" on branch "remote_join2"
        And that "join" build uses the same SHA as the "simple" build on branch "remote_join1"

    Scenario: Join Job from External Trigger
        Given an existing pipeline on branch "external_trigger1" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires  |
            | trigger   | ~commit   |
        And an existing pipeline on branch "external_trigger2" with the workflow jobs:
            | job       | requires              |
            | main      | ~sd@?:trigger         |
            | parallel1 | main                  |
            | parallel2 | main                  |
            | join      | parallel1, parallel2  |
        When a new commit is pushed to "external_trigger1" branch with the trigger jobs
        And the "trigger" job is triggered on branch "external_trigger1"
        And the "trigger" build succeeded
        And the "main" build's parentBuildId on branch "external_trigger2" is that "trigger" build's buildId
        And the "main" build succeeded
        And the "parallel1" build's parentBuildId on branch "external_trigger2" is that "main" build's buildId
        And the "parallel1" build succeeded
        And the "parallel2" build's parentBuildId on branch "external_trigger2" is that "main" build's buildId
        And the "parallel2" build succeeded
        Then the "join" job is triggered from "parallel1" and "parallel2" on branch "external_trigger2"
        And that "join" build uses the same SHA as the "main" build on branch "external_trigger2"
