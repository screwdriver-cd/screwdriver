## Scripts

Scripts used for setting up functional tests

### Creating a test user

The script `create-test-user` will create a user in your database. Run this script with a username and SCM access token, and the script will create the user and print an API token for use in tests to `stdout`.

```bash
$ npm run create-test-user -- test-user git-access-token
```

Put the token generated by the script in your `.func_config` file (or set it as an environment variable) as `API_TOKEN`.

In addition, you will have to remove the `temporaryAccessUser` and `temporaryAccessKey` from your `screwdriver/config/local.yaml`.
