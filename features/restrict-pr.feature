Feature: Restrict-pr

    The user wants to control the execution of the PR job depending on the source and destination of the Pull Request.

    Rules:
        -ã€€The restrict-pr setting allows the following controls
        -- none: Start all PR build
        -- fork: Do not start PR build from fork
        -- branch: Do not start PR build from same repository
        -- all: Do not start all PR build

    Scenario: Create a pull request from the same repository
        Given an existing pipeline with the source directory "none" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
            And an existing pipeline with the source directory "fork" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
            And an existing pipeline with the source directory "branch" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
            And an existing pipeline with the source directory "all" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
        When a branch is created for test_branch on "screwdriver-cd-test" organization
            And a new file is added to the "none" directory
            And a new file is added to the "fork" directory
            And a new file is added to the "branch" directory
            And a new file is added to the "all" directory
            And a pull request is opened from the "screwdriver-cd-test" organization
        Then the PR job of "none" is triggered because it is not restricted
            And the PR job of "fork" is triggered because it is not restricted
            And the PR job of "branch" is not triggered because it is restricted
            And the PR job of "all" is not triggered because it is restricted

    Scenario: Create a pull request from the forked repository
        Given an existing pipeline with the source directory "none" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
            And an existing pipeline with the source directory "fork" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
            And an existing pipeline with the source directory "branch" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
            And an existing pipeline with the source directory "all" and with the workflow jobs:
            | job           | requires          |
            | main          | ~pr               |
        When a branch is created for test_branch on "screwdriver-cd" organization
            And a new file is added to the "none" directory
            And a new file is added to the "fork" directory
            And a new file is added to the "branch" directory
            And a new file is added to the "all" directory
            And a pull request is opened from the "screwdriver-cd" organization
        Then the PR job of "none" is triggered because it is not restricted
            And the PR job of "branch" is triggered because it is not restricted
            And the PR job of "fork" is not triggered because it is restricted
            And the PR job of "all" is not triggered because it is restricted
